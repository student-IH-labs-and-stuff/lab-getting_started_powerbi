Refer to the `files_for_lab/we_fn_use_c_marketing_customer_value_analysis.csv` dataset.

### Instructions
1. Load the dataset to your PowerBI workbook.
2. Go to Transform Data. Review the data values in fields and column data types. 
3. Change decimal fields customer lifetime value and claim amount to fixed decimals (2 decimal places) by adding a transform step. Bonus - rename the steps as 'reduce decimals <fieldname>' for transparency
4. Review column names to confirm they are correct and clear before saving and loading the changes to your workbook
5. Select the first bar chart in the visualisations pane with Number of Policies and Coverage- to show the number of policies per **Coverage type**. Note the title now matches the purpose of the chart. Rename the tab 'bar chart'
